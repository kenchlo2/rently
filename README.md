# Rently

This project aims to search real estate in US and discover properties with viable investment opportunities for rent. It unifies the property value with rent levels of comparable units in the neighborhood to provide investment recommendations as a rental unit.

The application supports two search methods:

- **Single-address search:** Enter the address of a listing property in the search bar located at the top-right corner of the map, and select the appropriate one from the drop-down list. The target property will be marked on the map with a green pin. Click the green pin to display info about the property, including a recommendation (Strong Buy / No Buy / Strong No Buy) whether it's a viable investment opportunity as a rental property.

- **Area search:** Enter a city of interest in the search bar, and select one from the drop-down list. Listing properties in the area will be marked with red pins on the map. Click a red pin to display the specifics about a target property and check the investment recommendation.

In the case of area search, users may use the filter (currently including price range, # of bedrooms and bathrooms, and home type) to find properties matching these criteria the best. Specify the filtering criteria before selecting a search result from the drop-down list.

If users opt for registering an account on the site, they may save any property they find desirable in the favorite list by clicking the &hearts; icon in the pop-up.
